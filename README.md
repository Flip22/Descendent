Hi!


My name is Flip and I'm trying GitHub for the first time, giving it a whirl, because I hate my day jobs and hopefully I'll enjoy doing this a lot more so I can pursue something more.
My parents talk down to me because I don't live the life they approve. Fuck it, right? Who cares what others think. I follow my heart not other people's emotions.
